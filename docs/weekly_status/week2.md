# Week 2 (May 28 - June 3, 2023)

## Meeting outcome from previous week

- Outcome: Correlation is fine. Let's stick to 4 inches.
- Todo: Identify food and its categofy. Test actual meal what I consume on a daily basis. 

## Topic covered in this week

- Image Classifier
- ML Model, train, weight, and loss
- Neuron Networks
- Segmentation
- Kaggle, Jupyter, PyTorch, and SAM (Segment Anything Model) by Meta

## Next week

- [Volume estimation] Image - 120 degree (360 is too much). 
- [Segmentation] Gray out if it's not a food.
- [Volume estimation] Light affects the outcoome? Compute the Volume in different light (when it's dark, if it's recognizable)
- [Volume estimation] Food is not isolated, can we still compute it?
- Note: Never try to be perfectionist
