# Week 7 (July 2 - July 8, 2023)

## Last week

- Each segmented object should be clickable
  - let user get involved.
  - user can also select/group segmented objects (just like google image 'select' option).
  - opting out "gray out" annotation!

## Study

- `cloudmersive` is another option which has ability to detect/classify object in the given image
- But the accuracy is not enough to convince me to switch to it. 


## Next week
