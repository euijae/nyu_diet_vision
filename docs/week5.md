# Week 5 (June 18 - June 24, 2023)

## Last week

- CLIP to identify the food in the 101 categories
- SAM to segment and get the area of the different segments.
- User indicates which is food and corrects any guesses that SAM has made.
- Volume estimation of the whole meal using HelloPhoto, yielding Volume
- Allocate to each segment the proportion of the volume based on that
segment's area with respect to the area of all the food (Example: If fish occupies 30% of the food area then allocate 30% of
V to the fish).
- Outcome: Given the volume of each item, need to map that into grams and then into nutritional value for our four nutrients.
- Output would be: nutrients for each segment AND total nutrients for all segments.
