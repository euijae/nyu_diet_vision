# Week 6 (June 25 - July 1, 2023)

## Last week

- `DietVision` (Food segmentation and classification)
  - `is_food()` should not be pre-determined. User can correct DietVision's prediction. 
  - More specifically, UI should have a dropdown menu and let them select one from 101 classes.
- `HelloPhotogrammetry` (Volume estimation)
  - Find the simplest way to get the best result. Do we really need a picture of every angle?
  - A picture of top view is not enough to figure out 3D object generation?

## Study

- `HelloPhotogrammetry` (Volume estimation): A top view results in a distorted 3D object. 
- `DietVision`: A link to the weekly report ([here](./report/week6_report.md)).
