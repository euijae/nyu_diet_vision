# Report of the Week: June 25 - July 1, 2023

## Recap

- Explore the UI frameworks to present the DietVision demo
- Gray out a non-food segmentation and fill with an RGB color for a food segmentation
- A segmented object should be clickable and provides an user with its food class along with the area. But the class can be modified by user if it's incorrect.

## Study

### UI Option

1. Gradio: Great for a machine learning app presentation (easy to publish and offer an user friendly UI)
2. FastAPI: Fast and high performance web framework and one of the most famous options

### OpenCV's `bitwise` and masks
